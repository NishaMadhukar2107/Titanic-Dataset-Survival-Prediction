# Titanic-Dataset-Survival-Prediction
This dataset inlcudes columns like Age, Sex, Gender, Survival, PClass, Name etc. My task was to predict whether the passengers will survive or not and what are the important factors.
First I checked the shape of the data, datatypes in the dataset, checking null values.
Then I have imputed all the null values using median and categorical columns using mode.
EDA analysis was performed- Univariate analysis and Bivariate Analysis. 
Dropping the unnecessary columns such as cabin, AgeGroup
Model Building was done by using various models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, K nearest neighbour, Decision tree.. Out of which Random forest classifier gave the best performance.
Hyperparameter tuning was performed using Grid Search CV and Randomized Search CV.
